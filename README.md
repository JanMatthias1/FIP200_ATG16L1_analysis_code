FIP200 recruits ATG16L1 to the autophagosome via its CLAW domain

## Project Description

Dysregulation of autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components, is linked to various age and neurodegenerative diseases. The Unc-51-like kinase complex with three additional proteins, FIP200, ATG101, and ATG13, plays a critical role for autophagy initiation. While FIP200â€™s CLAW domain is the most conserved region across species, its exact function remains unclear. 

In this study, we show that the CLAW domain interacts with ATG16L1, suggesting a potential recruitment mechanism to the autophagosome. 

We identified that upon CLAW domain deletion and charge inversion, ATG13 and FIP200 co-localization is diminished. Subsequent immunoprecipitation analysis coupled with proteomic analysis revealed significant depletion of the ATG16L1-ATG5-ATG4 complex in the CLAW deletion and charge inversion conditions. 

Our findings demonstrate that in cell, ATG16L1 interacts with a cluster of positively-charged residues on the surface of the FIP200 CLAW domain. This represents a possible mechanism by which ATG16L1 is recruited to the naiscent phagophore. ATG16L1 is essential for autophagosome expansion, and impairment leads to dysfunctional autophagy.
